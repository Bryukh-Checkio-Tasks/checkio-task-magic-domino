    When Nikola can not find opponent for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes">Domino</a> game,
    he spread Magic Domino Solitaire.
    The goal of the solitaire is build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square">Magic square</a> with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes#Tiles_and_suits">Double Six</a> domino tiles.
</p>

<p>
    A magic square is an arrangement of distinct integers, in a square grid,
    where the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers in the forward and backward main diagonals,
    all add up to the same number.<br>
    Domino tiles contains two numbers from 0 (empty) to 6. Tiles are unordered and 1-6 is the same as 6-1.
    The double-six set contains 28 unique tiles - all combinations of number pairs.

</p>
<p>
    You are given a <strong>size</strong> for the magic square and a <strong>number</strong>.
    You should build a magic square by given <strong>size</strong>
    so that the sum of the horizontal and vertical diagonals equal the given <strong>number</strong>.
    You can place domino tiles from double-six set only <strong>vertically</strong> and they should be <strong>unique</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Here is example for <strong>size</strong> = 4 and <strong>number</strong> = 5:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img title="square"
         src="{{MEDIA}}square.png"
         alt="square"
         width="200px"/>
</p>

<p>
    The result magic square should be represented as as a list/tuple of lists/tuples with integers.
</p>


<p><strong>Input: </strong>Two arguments. A magic square size and a number as integers</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The magic square as a list/tuple of lists/tuples with integers.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio([1, 2, 3, 1, 3]) == [1, 3, 1, 3]
checkio([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == []

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This mission will help you to understand how to manipulate arrays,
    something that is the basis for solving more complex tasks.
    The concept can be easily generalized for real world tasks.
    For example: if you need to clarify statistics by removing low frequency elements (noise).

    <strong>Precondition:</strong></br>
    size in (4, 6)</br>
    All input test cases are solvable.
