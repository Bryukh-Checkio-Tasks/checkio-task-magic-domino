<p>
    Build square matrix <strong>w</strong>&#10005;<strong>w</strong> of integers, where sum of all numbers in each row, column and 
    diagonal equals <strong>s</strong>.
    This matrix should be builded from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes">classic domino tiles</a>
    (from 0 to 6 inclusive on each part of bone, also named double-six set).
</p>

<p>You get <strong>w</strong> and <strong>s</strong> (width/height of matrix and sum value) to your checkio function</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong></br>
    <i>4 <= w <= 6</i></br>
    All input values are correct, and matrix can be builded.
