<p>
    Build square matrix <strong>w</strong>&#10005;<strong>w</strong> of integers, where sum of numbers in each row, column and 
    diagonal equals <strong>s</strong>.
    This matrix should be builded from unique, vertically oriented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes">classic domino tiles</a>
    (from 0 to 6 inclusive on each half of tile, also named double-six set).
</p>
<p>
Here is example for <strong>w</strong> = 4 and <strong>s</strong> = 5
    <pre>
     5  5 5 5 5  5
        _______ 
     5 |0 0 2 3
     5 |0 4 1 0

     5 |4 0 0 1
     5 |1 1 2 1
    </pre>
</p>
<p>You get <strong>w</strong> and <strong>s</strong> (width/height of matrix and sum value) to your checkio function</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong></br>
    w in (4, 6)</br>
    All input values are solvable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hint:</strong></br>
    Your solution should run nearly half a minute on your local pc for thoughest inputs, so don't be afraid.
